# GearRefreshControl
A custom animation for the UIRefreshControl. Inspired by this [Dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1974767-gear-powered-pull-to-refresh-animation?list=animated&sort=popular&timeframe=now&offset=19) and [this tutorial](http://www.jackrabbitmobile.com/design/ios-custom-pull-to-refresh-control/). 

# Usage
Right now it's just a demo, I might make a library out of it, but I don't see the point right now, let me know in the Issue section if you are interested.
